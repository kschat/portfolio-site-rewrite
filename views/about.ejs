		<p>
			I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and work as a Software Engineer at UPMC. Although my preferred platform is Linux, I'm currently in a .NET environment at work. In my free time I like to work on side projects - my latest project being a class scheduler in Node.js â€“ I find it enjoyable and good way to keep up to date with the latest technologies. Besides programming I enjoy snowboarding in the winter and playing disk golf in the warmer seasons. If you'd like to contact me for any reason (besides for an open position, I get enough recruiter spam as it is) please send me an <a href="mailto:kyleschattler@gmail.com">email</a>.
