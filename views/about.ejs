		<p>
			I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and work as a Software Engineer at UPMC. Although my preferred platform is
			Linux, I'm currently in a .NET environment at work. In my free time I like to work on side projects - my latest
			project being a class scheduler in Node.js - to help sharpen my skills as a programmer.
