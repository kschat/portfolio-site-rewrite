I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and work primarily in Node.js. Programming
isn't just a job for me, it's also my hobby. I love learning anything I can
about programming and I'm always working on some kind of side project. Lately,
I've been trying my hand at functional programming by learning Haskell. Currently
I work at a company called Branding Brand, where I'm a fullstack developer working
on various clients mobile websites.

#### Frontend

I'm familiar with most of the big name frameworks, like Angular and Ember, along
with some of the less popular ones like Backbone; if need be, I have no problem
working with plain JavaScript as well. CSS is no problem for me either, and I'm
very familiar with preprocessors (I used to prefer SASS, but I have since switched
to Stylus and loving it). Supporting a wide range of browsers is something I'm
no stranger to, either. I've written sites specifically for IE 7 & 8, mobile
only sites, and fully responsive sites.

#### Backend

Like I mentioned earlier, I primarily work with Node.js, but before that I've
worked with C#, Java, PHP, and Haskell (although, that one I'm still very much a
beginner). I've built RESTful APIs, worked with SOAP endpoints, and built
microservices. Working with a databases is no problem for me either - I've
worked with MySQL, MSSQL, and MongoDB.

#### Devops & Tooling

I've done a few freelance projects in the past and have experience deploying and
managing clients sites. I automate things as often as I can, and have no problem
writing up a quick shell script to get a job done fast. I'm familiar with Windows,
altough I prefer to work in Linux (currently running Arch and loving it) or OS X.
