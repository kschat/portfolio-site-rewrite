#### Scrum Poker

A small web app I made that helped with estimating points for tasks at the
beginning of sprints. My goal was to rely on JavaScript as little as possible
and try to achieve as much as possible with CSS3. The only things that require
JavaScript are loading of different point units, and applying a few classes.
