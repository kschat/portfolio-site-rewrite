#### ChampionJS

ChampionJS is an MVP JavaScript framework that uses "dumb" views and
event binding to keep your code structured, and easily testable. This
framework started as a foundation for a single page app I was working
on at UPMC, but continued to grow after the project. It was a great
learning experience and gave me great insight into what goes into
writing a frontend framework.
