#### Portfolio Site

My attempt at creating my own, custom portfolio site from scratch. It was
originally written in PHP when I was college, but was completely rewritten in
2013 to get a better feel for Node.js. It was a very good learning experience
and is always a wake up call to how much I've learned whenever I come back to
modify it.
