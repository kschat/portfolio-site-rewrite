#### No BuzzFeed

A small Chrome extension I wrote at the request of a friend. The extension
scrapes Facebook for any BuzzFeed posts and removes them from the DOM. My goal
was to make it as small as possible and have no external dependencies, while
still being configurable and a fully installable Chrome Extension. I managed to
make it in 51 LOC.
